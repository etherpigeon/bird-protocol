# Introduction

Bird Finance is a platform built to assist liquidity providers of [Curve Finance](https://polygon.curve.fi)
on the [Polygon Network](https://polygon.technology) maximize their yield, without sacrificing their CRV.
Bird Finance was inspired by platforms like [Convex Finance](https://convexfinance.com) and [Yearn Finance](https://yearn.finance)
on the [Ethereum Network](https://ethereum.org). However, unlike those two protocols, Bird Finance takes a hybrid approach to yield optimization,
by harvesting non-CRV rewards for reinvestment, leaving CRV available to claim for long term hodling, and only charging a minimal 10% admin fee[^1].

[^1]: Admin fee is deducted from non-CRV rewards, and distributed to Guano token stakers
